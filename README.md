This script lets you filter results from different Code Scanning runs in the GitHub Security tab using a custom tag.

This is useful when dealing with monorepos that have code for several different projects in the same repository. You can use this tool to mark each project with a unique tag, and then filter the results in the GitHub Security tab to only show results for a specific project.

The SARIF is edited before upload to Code Scanning, applying one or more tags to each query/rule. The tags are attached to each Code Scanning result in the GitHub Security tab, and can be used to filter results in the web user interface:

It can run as a GitHub Action, or at the command-line.

## Example as an Action

We must modify an existing Code Scanning Actions workflow file to add the `tag-sarif` action, and add the literal tag `custom-tag` to each rule (and so to each result). You need to change that tag to something suitable for your use, such as a team name or a project name.

For example, if we are using the CodeQL action, we change the single `analyze` step from this:

```yaml
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

To:

```yaml
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      with:
        upload: False
        output: sarif-results

    - name: Tag SARIF
      uses: advanced-security/tag-sarif@main
      with:
        tags: custom-tag
        input: sarif-results/${{ matrix.language }}.sarif
        output: sarif-results/${{ matrix.language }}.sarif
      
    - name: Upload SARIF
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: sarif-results/${{ matrix.language }}.sarif
```

Note how we provided `upload: False` and `output: sarif-results` to the `analyze` action. That way we can edit the SARIF with the `tag-sarif` action before uploading it with the `upload-sarif` action.

A full example workflow is:

```yaml
name: "Tag SARIF"
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'java' ]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      with:
        upload: False
        output: sarif-results

    - name: Tag SARIF
      uses: advanced-security/tag-sarif@main
      with:
        tags: custom-tag
        input: sarif-results/${{ matrix.language }}.sarif
        output: sarif-results/${{ matrix.language }}.sarif

    - name: Upload SARIF
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: sarif-results/${{ matrix.language }}.sarif

    - name: Upload SARIF results as a Build Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: sarif-results
        path: sarif-results
        retention-days: 1
```

In this full example we also attach the resulting SARIF file to the build as a Build Artifact, which is convenient for later inspection. You can remove this step if you don't need it.

## Example at the command-line

```python
python3 tag_sarif.py test.sarif --custom-tags example-tag --output-sarif test.sarif
```
